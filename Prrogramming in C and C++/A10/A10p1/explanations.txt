a) When you comment out namespace std we have used many standard functions such as cin and cout without the name space.
The compiler cannot read cin just like that. The correct convention is to use std::cin. The same follows for
other functions as well therfore either we should decalre all the cin, cout and other librbary functions with
std:: or just use namespace std;.

b) When we comment out Critter:: the compiler will not be able to diffrentiate between which function we are talking.
The function that we are talking about is inside the class therfore we need to specify the class therfore we add 
Critter::.
